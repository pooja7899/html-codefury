    <h1>Information About Tsunamis</h1>

    <h2>What is a Tsunami?</h2>
    <p>
      A tsunami is a series of large ocean waves caused by the sudden
      displacement of water, usually due to underwater earthquakes, volcanic
      eruptions, or landslides. Tsunamis can cause extensive damage to coastal
      areas and pose significant risks to life and property.
    </p>

    <h2>Tsunami Safety Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Know the Warning Signs:</strong> Be aware of natural warning
        signs such as a sudden and unusual withdrawal of the sea or strong
        ground shaking.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Have an Evacuation Plan:</strong> Identify and practice
        evacuation routes leading to higher ground away from the coast.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Stay Informed:</strong> Listen to official warnings and alerts
        from local authorities and tsunami warning systems.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Move to Higher Ground:</strong> If you feel a strong earthquake
        or receive a tsunami alert, immediately move to higher ground and stay
        there until the all-clear is given.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Do Not Return Early:</strong> Do not return to coastal areas
        until authorities have confirmed it is safe to do so.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Post-Tsunami Safety Measures</h2>
    <ul>

        injuries. Provide first aid and seek medical help if needed.
      </li>
