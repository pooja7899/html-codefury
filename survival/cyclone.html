    <h1>Information About Cyclones</h1>

    <h2>What is a Cyclone?</h2>
    <p>
      A cyclone is a large-scale air mass that rotates around a strong center of
      low atmospheric pressure. Cyclones are characterized by their circular
      wind patterns and can cause severe weather conditions. Here are some key
      points about cyclones:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Definition:</strong> A system of winds rotating inward to an
        area of low pressure, typically causing heavy rain and strong winds.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Types:</strong> Cyclones are known by different names depending
        on their location: hurricanes in the Atlantic, typhoons in the Western
        Pacific, and cyclones in the Indian Ocean.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Categories:</strong> Cyclones are classified into different
        categories based on their wind speeds and potential for damage.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Impacts:</strong> Cyclones can cause flooding, storm surges, and
        significant damage to infrastructure and ecosystems.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cyclone Safety Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Stay Informed:</strong> Continuously monitor weather updates and
        alerts from reliable sources such as the National Weather Service or
        local authorities.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Emergency Kit:</strong> Prepare an emergency kit with essential
        items such as water, non-perishable food, medications, batteries, a
        flashlight, a first-aid kit, and important documents.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Evacuation Plans:</strong> Have a clear evacuation plan and know
        multiple routes to safe areas. Practice evacuation drills with your
        family.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Secure Property:</strong> Reinforce windows and doors to protect
        against strong winds and secure any loose items outside that could
        become dangerous projectiles.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Flood Precautions:</strong> If you live in a flood-prone area,
        elevate electrical appliances and utilities, and move valuables to
        higher ground.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Stay Indoors:</strong> During the cyclone, stay indoors and away
        from windows and exterior walls. If instructed, move to a designated
        safe area or storm shelter.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Follow Instructions:</strong> Adhere to evacuation orders and
        safety advice from local authorities. Do not return to your home until
        it is declared safe.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Post-Cyclone Safety Measures</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Check for Injuries:</strong> Assess yourself and others for
        injuries. Provide first aid and seek medical attention if necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Inspect Your Home:</strong> Check for structural damage, gas
        leaks, and electrical issues. Evacuate if the building is unsafe and
        report hazards to authorities.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Avoid Downed Power Lines:</strong> Stay away from fallen power
        lines and report them to the utility company.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Check for Gas Leaks:</strong> If you suspect a gas leak, turn
        off the gas supply, leave the area, and contact your gas company
        immediately.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Clear Debris Safely:</strong> Remove debris carefully, avoiding
        any hazards such as sharp objects or unstable structures.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Use Flashlights, Not Candles:</strong> Use flashlights instead
        of candles to avoid fire hazards in the event of power outages.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Follow Local News:</strong> Stay updated with information from
        local news and authorities regarding recovery efforts and safety
        instructions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Report Damage:</strong> Document and report any damage to your
        property to your insurance company for claims processing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Protect Your Health:</strong> Be cautious of potential
        contamination in floodwaters and ensure you have access to clean
        drinking water.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Stay Connected:</strong> Keep in touch with family, friends, and
        neighbors to ensure everyone's safety and offer assistance if needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare for Additional Storms:</strong> Stay alert for any
        further weather warnings and be prepared to respond if additional storms
        or aftershocks occur.
      </li>
    </ul>
