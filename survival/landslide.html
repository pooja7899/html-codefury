    <h1>Information About Landslides</h1>

    <h2>What is a Landslide?</h2>
    <p>
      A landslide is the movement of rock, soil, and debris down a slope due to
      gravity. This can be triggered by heavy rainfall, earthquakes, volcanic
      activity, or human activities. Landslides can cause significant damage to
      property and pose risks to life and infrastructure.
    </p>

    <h2>Landslide Safety Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Be Aware of Warning Signs:</strong> Look for signs of potential
        landslides such as cracks in walls, leaning trees, or changes in the
        ground.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare an Emergency Kit:</strong> Have essentials like water,
        food, a flashlight, and first-aid supplies readily available.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Develop an Evacuation Plan:</strong> Know your evacuation routes
        and have a plan for quickly moving to a safer location.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Monitor Weather Conditions:</strong> Stay informed about weather
        forecasts and be alert to heavy rain or other conditions that might
        increase landslide risk.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Secure Your Home:</strong> Reinforce foundations and slopes
        around your home to reduce the risk of landslides.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Post-Landslide Safety Measures</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Check for Injuries:</strong> Assess yourself and others for
        injuries and seek medical help if needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Inspect Your Property:</strong> Examine your home for damage and
        avoid entering unstable areas. Report significant damage to authorities
        and your insurance company.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Stay Away from Hazardous Areas:</strong> Avoid areas prone to
        further landslides and follow local evacuation orders.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Be Cautious of Debris:</strong> Watch for dangerous debris and
        avoid touching or moving anything that could be hazardous.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Follow Local Updates:</strong> Keep up with recovery information
        and safety instructions from local authorities and emergency services.

        <strong>Prepare for Future Risks:</strong> Consider measures to mitigate
        future landslide risks, such as reinforcing slopes and improving
        drainage systems.
