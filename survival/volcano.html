    <h1>Information About Volcanoes</h1>

    <h2>What is a Volcano?</h2>
    <p>
      A volcano is a rupture in the Earth's crust where molten lava, ash, and
      gases can escape. Eruptions can range from minor lava flows to
      catastrophic explosions, impacting surrounding areas and altering
      landscapes.
    </p>

    <h2>Volcano Safety Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Know the Risks:</strong> Understand the volcanic hazards
        specific to your area, such as lava flows, ashfall, or pyroclastic
        flows.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Emergency Kit:</strong> Prepare an emergency kit with essentials
        like water, food, masks, and first-aid supplies to protect against ash
        inhalation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Evacuation Plan:</strong> Have a clear evacuation plan and know
        multiple routes to safety, avoiding areas prone to lava flows and
        ashfall.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Stay Informed:</strong> Monitor alerts from local authorities
        and volcano monitoring services for timely updates and instructions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Protect Your Health:</strong> Use masks and protective eyewear
        to shield yourself from ash and dust. Avoid contact with contaminated
        water and food.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Post-Eruption Safety Measures</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Check for Injuries:</strong> Assess yourself and others for
        injuries and seek medical help if needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Inspect Property:</strong> Check for damage caused by lava, ash,
        or explosions. Avoid entering damaged buildings until itâ€™s deemed safe.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Clear Ash Safely:</strong> Remove ash from roofs and driveways
        carefully using appropriate tools to prevent collapse and avoid inhaling
        ash.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Avoid Contaminated Water:</strong> Do not use or drink water
        that may be contaminated with volcanic ash.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Follow Local Guidance:</strong> Adhere to advice and
        instructions from local authorities and emergency services for recovery
        and safety.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Document Damage:</strong> Take photos of property damage for
        insurance purposes and recovery documentation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Check for Gas Leaks:</strong> If you smell gas, turn off the gas
        supply and contact the gas company immediately.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Protect Your Health:</strong> Continue using masks and eyewear
        to protect against lingering ash and dust.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Stay Updated:</strong> Keep up with recovery efforts and updates
        from local authorities to stay informed about ongoing risks and safety
        measures.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Help Others:</strong> Assist neighbors and community members who
        may need help, especially those who are more vulnerable.
      </li>
