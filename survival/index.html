                <h3>Earthquake</h3>
                       <p> After an earthquake, it’s crucial to take safety precautions. Here are some guidelines to follow:....
                        1] Expect Aftershocks: These smaller earthquakes can occur minutes, days, or even months after the initial quake. If you feel an aftershock, remember to DROP, COVER, and HOLD ON. If you’re in a tsunami-prone area, head inland and seek higher ground.
2] Attract Attention if Trapped: Use your phone to send a text, bang on walls or pipes, or use a whistle to help rescuers locate you.
3] Protect Yourself: Shield your mouth, nose, and eyes from dust. Attend to any wounds promptly to prevent infection.
4] Help Others: If you’re able, assist others in need.
5] Stay Informed: Listen to emergency information via battery-operated TV/radio, social media, or text alerts. Save phone calls for emergencies.
6] Inspect Your Home: Check walls, floors, doors, windows, and staircases for damage. If you smell gas or see a broken line, shut off the main valve from outside (a professional must restore gas service).
