    <h1>Information About Earthquakes</h1>

    <h2>What is an Earthquake?</h2>
    <p>
      An earthquake is the shaking of the Earth's surface caused by the sudden
      release of energy in the Earth's crust. This release of energy causes
      seismic waves that can lead to ground shaking and surface ruptures. Here
      are some key points about earthquakes:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Definition:</strong> A sudden and rapid shaking of the Earth's
        surface due to the movement of tectonic plates.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Causes:</strong> Earthquakes are primarily caused by tectonic
        plate movements, volcanic activity, or human activities such as mining.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Magnitude:</strong> The size of an earthquake is measured on the
        Richter scale or Moment Magnitude Scale (Mw), which indicates the amount
        of energy released.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Impacts:</strong> Earthquakes can cause damage to buildings,
        infrastructure, and landscapes, as well as trigger secondary hazards
        like landslides and tsunamis.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Earthquake Safety Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare an Emergency Kit:</strong> Include essentials such as
        water, non-perishable food, a flashlight, batteries, a first-aid kit,
        medications, and important documents.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Create an Emergency Plan:</strong> Develop a family emergency
        plan and establish a meeting place. Practice earthquake drills
        regularly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Secure Your Home:</strong> Fasten heavy furniture and appliances
        to walls, and keep breakable items in secure cabinets.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Retrofitting:</strong> Strengthen your home’s foundation and
        ensure it meets seismic safety standards if you live in an
        earthquake-prone area.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>During an Earthquake:</strong> Drop to your hands and knees,
        take cover under a sturdy piece of furniture, and hold on until the
        shaking stops.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>If Outdoors:</strong> Move to an open area away from buildings,
        trees, and power lines. Drop to the ground and protect your head and
        neck.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>If Driving:</strong> Pull over to a safe location away from
        bridges and overpasses. Remain in your vehicle with your seatbelt
        fastened until the shaking stops.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>If Trapped:</strong> Try to stay calm, make noise or use a
        whistle to alert rescuers, and tap in a regular pattern if you can.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Post-Earthquake Safety Measures</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Check for Injuries:</strong> Assess yourself and others for
        injuries. Provide first aid and seek medical attention if necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Inspect Your Home:</strong> Check for structural damage, gas
        leaks, and electrical issues. Evacuate if the building is unsafe and
        report hazards to authorities.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Avoid Downed Power Lines:</strong> Stay away from fallen power
        lines and report them to the utility company immediately.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Check for Gas Leaks:</strong> If you suspect a gas leak, turn
        off the gas supply, leave the area, and contact your gas company.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Be Cautious of Aftershocks:</strong> Expect aftershocks
        following the main earthquake. Stay alert and be prepared to drop,
        cover, and hold on if needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Clear Debris Safely:</strong> Remove debris carefully, avoiding
        any hazards such as sharp objects or unstable structures.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Use Flashlights, Not Candles:</strong> Use flashlights instead
        of candles to avoid fire hazards in case of power outages.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Follow Local News:</strong> Stay updated with information from
        local authorities and media regarding recovery efforts and safety
        instructions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Report Damage:</strong> Document and report any damage to your
        property to your insurance company for claims processing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Protect Your Health:</strong> Be cautious of potential
        contamination in water and ensure you have access to clean drinking
        water.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Stay Connected:</strong> Keep in touch with family, friends, and
        neighbors to ensure everyone’s safety and offer assistance if needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare for Additional Shocks:</strong> Be prepared for possible
        additional aftershocks and follow safety guidelines as needed.
      </li>
    </ul>
