    <h1>Information About Floods</h1>

    <h2>What is a Flood?</h2>
    <p>
      A flood occurs when water overflows onto normally dry land, often due to
      heavy rainfall, river overflow, or storm surges. Floods can cause
      significant damage to property and pose serious risks to safety.
    </p>
